## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives concise, direct task instructions for graphics/image generation; 17× (stable since 2025-09-01) [refs: successive 3D mockup & gradient background requests chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`; new MacBook request chatId:`2e2b70530cf142`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests text-free/minimalist visuals; 5× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: “i dont want text” request chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`; MacBook request chatId:`2e2b70530cf142`]
- asks for vector formats to ensure scalability; 2× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: vector MacBook request chatId:`2e2b70530cf142`; repeat vector request chatId:`2e2b70530cf142`]
- uses single-word commands (e.g., “CONFIRM”) to request status updates; 1× (first: 2025-09-05) [ref: video generation confirmation chatId:`d2cfbde6677942`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
