## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives concise, direct task instructions for graphics/image generation; 16× (promoted from emerging) [refs: successive 3D mockup & gradient background requests chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests text-free/minimalist visuals; 3× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: “i dont want text”, hot-pink gradient version chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- creating marketing mockups with gradient backgrounds and floating laptops; 20× (since 2025-09-01) [refs: multiple mockup iterations chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iteratively refines visuals, requesting angle, layout, color, and size adjustments; 20× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: step-by-step refinement sequence chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- frequently uses platform to generate 3D graphic assets/mockups; 20× (since 2025-09-01) [refs: repeated image generation calls chatId:`607d0969a2f34b`]
