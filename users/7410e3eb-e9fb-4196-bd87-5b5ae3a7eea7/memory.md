## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- Provides clear, targeted instructions for very specific visual edits (eyes, nose, tattoo, strawberry); 7× [refs: successive requests for eye, nose, tattoo & strawberry fixes chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]
- Supplies direct image URLs for processing in each request; 6× [refs: multiple image URL submissions chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- Requests removal of small unwanted objects (tattoo, strawberry) while keeping rest of image unchanged; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: tattoo and strawberry removal requests chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]
- Prefers follow-up confirmation that edits kept rest of image unchanged; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: feedback after conservative edits chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- (none yet)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- Refining AI-generated character images with iterative facial and object touch-ups; 4× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: series of eye, nose, tattoo, strawberry edits chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- Detail-oriented; requests granular adjustments rather than broad edits; 7× [refs: eye-only, nose-only, object removal fixes chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- Prefers conservative incremental edits after overcorrections; 4× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: asked for "conservative settings" repeatedly chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- Uses platform primarily for AI-powered image editing tasks; 8× [refs: sequential image edit requests chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- Requests iterative improvement cycles on same image; 3× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: multiple passes on eye, nose, object edits chatId:`c701f0d169ba48`]
