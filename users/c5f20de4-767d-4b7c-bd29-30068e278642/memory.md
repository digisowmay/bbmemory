## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- issues short, imperative commands for visual edits (e.g., "make him slightly more muscular", "give him a face full of beard"); 6× (stable since 2025-08-31) [refs: multiple image edit requests in chat about physique, beard, dark circles]
### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- prefers quick, iterative adjustments and immediate results; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: successive requests for more muscle, fuller beard]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- none
### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- actively engaged in personal photo editing to enhance appearance (muscles, facial hair, skin); 3× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: image edits for muscular body, beard styles, removing dark circles]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core patterns)
- seeks perfection through incremental refinements; 4× [refs: step-by-step edits from muscular tweaks to beard density and dark circle removal]
### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- evaluates multiple visual styles before deciding (clean shaven vs beard); 1× (observed: 2025-08-31) [ref: comparison between refined beard and clean-shaven look]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently uses platform for image manipulation and transformation requests; 5× [refs: series of photo edit commands in this session]
### Emerging (new query patterns)
- explores grooming/style options through visual mock-ups; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: beard style refinements, clean-shaven version generation]
