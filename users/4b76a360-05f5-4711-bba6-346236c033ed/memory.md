## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
-

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests direct, ready-to-use assets (e.g., JSON workflow code) instead of long explanations; 3× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: original n8n workflow request chatId:`a7747816784045`; follow-up JSON fix request chatId:`a7747816784045`; current "fix the nodes" message chatId:`a7747816784045`]
- provides immediate, terse feedback on delivered assets ("nodes are broken", "still same") and expects corrections; 3× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: feedback loops chatId:`a7747816784045`]
- shares own JSON snippets and asks for targeted corrections rather than fresh builds; 1× (first: 2025-09-05) [ref: pasted full JSON workflow for fixing chatId:`a7747816784045`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
-

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- building SaaS products and automations; 3× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: wants social media scraper SaaS idea chatId:`a7747816784045`; multiple workflow fix requests]
- familiar with n8n and interested in web scraping for market research; 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: n8n workflows, Reddit/Twitter scraping chatId:`a7747816784045`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
-

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iterative quick-fix cycle: gives brief feedback and expects successive corrections; 2× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: repeated "still same" and "fix the nodes" exchanges chatId:`a7747816784045`]
- favors low-dependency, simplified solutions that work out-of-the-box; 1× (first: 2025-09-05) [ref: requested simple version without external APIs chatId:`a7747816784045`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
-

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- frequently asks for coding/automation workflows (n8n, scraping); 3× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: multiple workflow creation and fix requests chatId:`a7747816784045`]
