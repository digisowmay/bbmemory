## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- specifies language preference for technical diagrams—initially bilingual then explicitly English-only; 3× (last: 2025-09-02) [refs: diagram bilingual request; English-only instruction chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`; English-only preference reaffirmation chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)  
- designing blockchain-based bus approval system (architecture diagrams, smart contracts, Next.js stack); 1× (started: 2025-09-02) [ref: conceptual framework message chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iterative refinement approach—asks for improvements and adjustments to diagrams and content; 2× (last: 2025-09-02) [refs: requested improved diagrams chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`; English-only version request chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- uses platform to generate architecture diagrams and conceptual frameworks (field monitoring and blockchain systems); 3× (since 2025-09-02) [refs: initial diagram generation; field monitoring diagrams; blockchain system diagram chatId:`6662dea344ef4a`]
