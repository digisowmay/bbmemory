## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- provides extremely detailed cinematic directives (camera height, lens mm, lighting, era references); 4× [refs: multiple elevator scene prompts; hallway bird’s-eye prompt; curbside limo prompt chatId:`7739da56152540`]
- requests quick “redo” iterations to fine-tune creative output; 3× (promoted from emerging) [refs: redo commands in image workflow chatId:`7739da56152540`; earlier redo in conversation]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- favors 9:16 vertical framing in most image requests; 2× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: latest OTS prompt; bird’s-eye hallway prompt]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- strong grasp of film cinematography terminology and 1960s period aesthetics; 3× [refs: references to Deakins, Fincher, Welles; lens specs in prompts; tungsten vs fluorescent lighting details]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- working on a themed series of corporate elevator and corridor scenes; 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: elevator exit, hallway bodies, OTS prompts]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- highly detail-oriented and specification-driven; expects strict adherence to prompt parameters; 3× [refs: multiple precise angle/light requirements; camera mm details; aspect-ratio demands]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iterative creative workflow: tests scene variants sequentially (bird’s-eye, OTS, curbside) to build narrative; 2× (started 2025-09-05) [refs: sequential scene progression chatId:`7739da56152540`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently generates cinematic-style images with detailed prompts; 4× [refs: all image generation requests in current session]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- exploring dramatic corporate suspense visuals (motionless employees theme); 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: hallway with bodies prompts; corridor OTS prompt]
