## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- asks clarifying questions about cron semantics and timing accuracy; 2× (last: 2025-09-06) [refs: every-30-minutes vs :30 discussion chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; sub-hourly scheduling request chatId:`36ce0bd5657547`]
- demands raw JSON output exactly "as is" and uses strong language when expectations aren't met; 2× (last: 2025-09-02) [refs: agent info JSON request chatId:`d18203936f144e`; prompt re-request with strong language chatId:`d18203936f144e`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- uses Bhindi scheduling to automate recurring reminders (water, pee break, jokes, physics); 3× [refs: recurring action #16 chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; schedule creation; deletions chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- enjoys periodic humor content via scheduled automation; 1× (started: 2025-09-02) [ref: joke and physics joke schedule creation chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]
- demonstrates familiarity with cron syntax and interval limitations; 1× (since 2025-09-02) [ref: cron semantics discussion chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- detail-oriented about system state; verifies IDs and internal DB details after operations; 6× [refs: cron clarification chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; mongodb detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; schedule manipulation]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- evaluates scheduling logic for correctness (interval vs fixed schedule); 1× (observed: 2025-09-02) [ref: true every-30-minutes request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently manages schedules (create, list, pause, delete) and checks counts; 10× (stable since 2025-09-01) [refs: schedule listing, deletion, id request, new schedule creation chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; schedule listing chatId:`6b369771688145`; delete all schedules chatId:`6b1cebcca93d48`; sync operation chatId:`fd93af3ddc694b`]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- directly requests raw MongoDB queries for schedule insights; 2× (since 2025-09-02) [refs: mongodb detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; water/pee detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]
- requests internal agent configuration details and performs sync operations; 4× (last: 2025-09-03) [refs: scheduler agent info request chatId:`d18203936f144e`; agent sync operation chatId:`d18203936f144e`; sync agents request chatId:`c99642772cc749`; scheduler agent sync chatId:`6b1cebcca93d48`]
