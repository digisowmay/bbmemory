## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- requests concise, action-oriented updates about schedule operations; 5× [refs: schedule deletion confirmation chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; schedule id query chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; mongodb detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- uses Bhindi scheduling to automate recurring reminders and content delivery (water, pee break, jokes, physics facts); 3× [refs: recurring action #16 chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; schedule creation earlier; deletions chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- detail-oriented about system state; verifies IDs and internal DB details after operations; 5× [refs: time mismatch question chatId:`bf71fbcbbe0047`; mongodb detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently manages schedules (create, list, pause, delete) and checks counts; 5× [refs: schedule listing, deletion, id request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`; earlier schedule operations]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- directly requests raw MongoDB queries for schedule insights; 1× (first: 2025-09-02) [ref: mongodb detail request chatId:`85ffbfdfe94742`]
