## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- casual, concise requests; uses direct asks and slang like "bro"; 4× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: memoryos agent query chatId:`1e311dd875cd48`]
- provides structured detail lists when specifying information; prefers incremental, blunt answers over sugarcoated ones; 2× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: memory profile specification chatId:`81b771b1030d41`; agent parameters list chatId:`81b771b1030d41`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- technical stack: Python, PyTorch, FAISS/pgvector, Docker, VS Code; strong interest in startups related to VectorDBs, meme search engines, pallet automation; 1× (since 2025-09-01) [ref: personal profile storage chatId:`81b771b1030d41`]
- current projects & goals: Vectra (VectorDB), MemeFindr (meme search), aims to build own startup rather than take a job; 1× (since 2025-09-01) [ref: personal profile storage chatId:`81b771b1030d41`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- learns best by doing short practical tasks and enjoys deep dives into systems (load balancers, gRPC, YARN); 1× (since 2025-09-01) [ref: personal profile storage chatId:`81b771b1030d41`]
- late-night coder: typical sprint hours 10 pm–2 am; 1× (since 2025-09-01) [ref: personal profile storage chatId:`81b771b1030d41`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- manages agent configurations (create/delete/inspect memory); 3× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: agent deletion request chatId:`4daf0386ab364d`; agent creation & query chatId:`81b771b1030d41`; memory inspection chatId:`1e311dd875cd48`]
- privacy-conscious; actively manages chat memory agents, requests deletion, and asks to inspect stored info; 2× (last: 2025-09-01) [refs: agent deletion request chatId:`4daf0386ab364d`; memory inspection chatId:`1e311dd875cd48`]
