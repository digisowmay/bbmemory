## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives concise, imperative instructions for visual edits; 12× (stable since 2025-09-03) [refs: ongoing family portrait iterations; “make her taller” instruction chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]
- insists on preserving original facial features with no retouching; 7× [refs: “maintain facial features, no retouch” requests chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests realistic color/light harmonization across composite images; 1× (first: 2025-09-03) [ref: “adjust their colors to make them look like they are in the same place” chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- creating highly realistic family portraits via image compositing; 2× (since 2025-09-03) [refs: multiple family portrait requests; height adjustment & background harmonization chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iterative refinement approach, providing incremental feedback on outputs; 10× (since 2025-08-31, last: 2025-09-03) [refs: repeated “try again” and background/lighting adjustments chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- using platform for image editing and background manipulation tasks; 11× [refs: current family portrait iterations; background change & color harmonization requests chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]
- prefers using “Nano Banana” model for image composition tasks; 4× [refs: repeated “use nano banana” instructions chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- emphasizing realism in composites (lighting, shadows, color); 1× (started: 2025-09-03) [ref: color/shadow harmonization request chatId:`940d86332ffa42`]
