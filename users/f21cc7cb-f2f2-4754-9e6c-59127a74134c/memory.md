## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- provides very precise, step-by-step image-editing instructions and expects exact visual results; 4× [refs: chat about replacing snack bag; iterative lighting/shadow adjustments; classroom scene edits; kitchen scene edits]
- prefers succinct confirmations with final image link rather than lengthy explanations; 3× [refs: multiple acknowledgements after each tool call; requests like “just add this bag as is”]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- emphasizes high-resolution outputs and realistic lighting integration; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: requests for 1440x1080, “harmonize lighting”]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- involved in product/visual marketing for CHICKA snack brand imagery; 3× [refs: repeated direction on various CHICKA bag variants]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)  
- currently producing a series of edited images featuring different CHICKA product flavors and scenarios; 2× (since 2025-08-30) [refs: classroom lemon bag, kitchen four cheese bag]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- uses iterative refinement: asks for successive small tweaks (size, lighting, shadows) until ideal; 4× [refs: bag bigger, open/closed, lighting passes]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- strong emphasis on photorealistic compositing with correct shadows and ambient occlusion; 2× (started 2025-08-31) [refs: requests to match warm kitchen light]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently leverages platform for advanced image manipulation and compositing tasks; 4× [refs: whole session of editing bags in various scenes]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- specifies exact output resolution (e.g., 1440×1080) and high-quality upscaling; 1× (first: 2025-08-31) [ref: request for upscaling and 1440x1080 classroom image]
