## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- insists no automated agents/tools without explicit permission; 3× (stable since 2025-09-01) [refs: instruction "dont use any agents without asking me"; credit deduction concern; twitter interaction commands chatId:`4bf3b72254ed4d`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- prefers incremental, preview-first delivery; 1× (observed: 2025-08-31) [ref: instruction to show first results before full output]
- asks for step-by-step, non-coding instructions due to limited coding ability; 4× (last: 2025-09-06) [refs: link extraction guidance chatId:`8d924052a5ec43`; Apollo API key instructions chatId:`7d3a748ab6a54f`; coding 7-day plan request chatId:`542de6d6b9f948`; coding 60-hour roadmap request chatId:`9262d14211fd49`]
