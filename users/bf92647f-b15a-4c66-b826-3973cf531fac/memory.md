## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- iterative visual feedback loop; repeatedly asks for incremental tweaks to images (e.g., messier hair, thinner mustache); 6× [refs: sequence of image edit requests about Freddie Mercury style hair and mustache]
- provides clear, specific style references (1970s/80s Freddie Mercury) for guidance; 5× [refs: multiple prompts specifying Freddie Mercury style hair and mustache]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- prefers concise confirmations of edits without extra explanation; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: responses acknowledged as "Perfect!"]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- working on realistic 3D open-source character styling referencing Freddie Mercury; 4× [refs: repeated requests to modify "realistic 3d open sourced character" images]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- focusing on hair length/texture variations for retro rock aesthetic; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: requests to adjust length/thickness on sides]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- incremental approach to design; prefers step-by-step refinement rather than one-off changes; 7× [refs: chain of requests adjusting mustache size, hair messiness]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- attention to historical style accuracy (1970s vs 1980s distinctions); 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: distinguishes between 70s long hair and 80s mustache]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequently uses image editing tool for stylistic adjustments; 8× [refs: continuous gemini-image_editImage calls]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- none at this time
