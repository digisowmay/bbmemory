## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- requests complete code/JSON deliverables in one go; 10× (stable since 2025-09-05) [refs: repeated JSON completeness requests chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
- provides rapid feedback on issues and asks for quick fixes; 10× [refs: "some nodes are broken", "json is not complete", "still same" chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- asks to add extensive feature lists before implementation; 4× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: "suggest some more features", "add all and give a single json file" chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
-
### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- building a ManyReach cold email clone using n8n automation; 5× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: workflow JSON discussions chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
-
### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- prefers turnkey, ready-to-use solutions over step-by-step guidance; 7× (observed: 2025-09-05) [refs: requested full JSON, "add all and give a single json file" chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
- iterative debugging approach—tests quickly and requests fixes; 10× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: "some nodes are broken", "json is not complete", "still same" chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
-
### Emerging (new query patterns)
- frequently asks for technical workflow automation and coding outputs; 8× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: n8n automation JSON requests chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
