## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
-

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests complete code/JSON deliverables in one go; 3× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: workflow JSON request; broken nodes fix request chatId:`e822411dd26745`; "still same" feedback chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
- provides rapid feedback on issues and asks for quick fixes; 2× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: "some nodes are broken" message chatId:`e822411dd26745`; "still same" reply chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
-

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- exploring n8n automation for cold email outreach cloning; 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: ManyReach clone discussion; node fix iterations chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Thinking & Working Style

-

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- prefers turnkey, ready-to-use solutions over step-by-step guidance; 2× (observed: 2025-09-05) [refs: requested full JSON; asked to fix broken nodes chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
- iterative debugging approach—tests quickly and requests fixes; 2× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: "some nodes are broken" then "still same" responses chatId:`e822411dd26745`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
-

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- frequently asks for technical workflow automation and coding outputs; 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: n8n automation JSON request; broken nodes fix chatId:`e822411dd26745`]
