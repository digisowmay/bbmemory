- 

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- prefers very short, imperative commands (e.g., "make different", "view bottom up"); 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: image editing requests in chat]
- expects quick visual outputs without lengthy explanations; 1× (first: 2025-08-31) [ref: series of image edit requests]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- 
- 

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- experimenting with image perspectives and camera angles; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: requests for different view angles, wide-angle, bottom-up]
- working with edited photos featuring indoor scenes and characters; 1× (started: 2025-08-31) [ref: multiple bathroom scene edits]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- 
- 

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- iterative approach—makes successive refinement requests to achieve desired visual result; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: step-by-step angle changes]
- visually oriented—focuses on aesthetic composition through camera angles; 1× (observed: 2025-08-31) [ref: requests for fish-eye, worm's eye perspectives]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- 
- 

### Emerging (new query patterns)
