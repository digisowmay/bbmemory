## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- prefers very brief, imperative commands for requests (e.g., "view bottom up", "different view"); 5× [refs: series of image angle requests on 2025-08-31]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- attempts to push for intimate focal points in images; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: "view butt to behind"; "view bottom up to butt"]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- frequently requests alternative camera perspectives (top-down, behind, wide-angle, bottom-up) for images; 5× [refs: different angle requests on 2025-08-31]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- exploring more sexualized angles in image edits; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: requests focusing on butt]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- iterative experimentation: sequentially refines requests with new angles until satisfied; 4× [refs: successive angle change messages on 2025-08-31]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- interested in dramatic perspective shifts (fish-eye, worm's eye) for creative composition; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: bottom-up, wide-angle fish-eye requests]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- uses platform repeatedly for AI-based image editing; 6× [refs: multiple gemini-image_editImage calls on 2025-08-31]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
