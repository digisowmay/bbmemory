## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- gives concise directive requests (e.g., "Make a website completely same as this", "where is the file"); 2× (last: 2025-09-03) [refs: website clone request chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`; file location query chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]
- expects explicit deliverables/file outputs; 1× (first: 2025-09-03) [ref: "where is the file" follow-up chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- working on/needs a full website clone for URL klmnko.de; 2× (since 2025-09-03) [refs: initial replicate website task; animation improvement request chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- prefers exact replication and fidelity checks (e.g., animations correctness); 2× (last: 2025-09-03) [refs: "completely same as this" instruction; "Animations are not cloned properly" feedback chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]
- iterative refinement approach – provides feedback for improvements; 1× (first: 2025-09-03) [ref: animation correction request chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- requests web development implementation/code directly; 2× (since 2025-09-03) [refs: initial code request; enhanced animations request chatId:`1e95603340eb4e`]
