## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives concise, precise instructions for image editing tasks; 24× (stable since 2025-09-04) [refs: multiple sequential image edit requests chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]
- insists on maintaining original proportions/style consistency; 4× (promoted from emerging) [refs: eye size correction request; style-preserving eye detail enhancement; head position fix; latest eye resize chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests removal of small objects/elements for cleaner composition; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: strawberry removal requests chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]
- specifies which editing tool/engine to use (e.g., "Nanobanana", "Flux"); 1× (first: 2025-09-04) [ref: left eye fix using Flux chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- highly interested in digital art and character images; 17× [refs: continuous image enhancement conversations chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]

- detail-oriented with strong focus on aesthetic accuracy (color, anatomy, proportions); 22× [refs: vein removal, eye detail enhancement, anatomy corrections chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]
- iterative refinement approach, requests multiple passes for perfection; 7× (promoted from emerging) [refs: successive edits on eyes, head, hand alignment chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- none currently

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- requests specific editing engines/models (Flux, Nanobanana) and compares results; 1× (since 2025-09-04) [ref: Flux eye correction request chatId:`a4bb27ad1a8f43`]
