## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives precise operational commands ("drop an echo", "create issue") expecting immediate execution; 4× [refs: echo to sowmay request; GitHub issue request; earlier stat queries across session]
- requests quantitative metrics about users/usage for defined time windows; 4× [refs: ask for users created in last 2 h; zero-message count; timezone breakdown; message intent]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- prefers concise summaries that capture only needed details; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: "ensure keep it concise" for GitHub issue; repeated ask for 'stat']

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- ops/admin role at upsurgeio overseeing Bhindi analytics & repos; 3× [refs: GitHub repo management commands; user analytics queries; paid subscriber follow-up]

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- monitoring onboarding funnel performance for new users; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: analysis of 99 new users; engagement bottleneck discussion]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core patterns)
- data-driven decision maker, asks for stats before actions; 5× [refs: zero-message stat before timezone check; tool usage counts before echo]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- proactively escalating high-value customer issues to team; 2× (started 2025-08-31) [refs: echo to sowmay about paid user; GitHub issue creation attempt]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- frequent database analytics via Mongo queries; 4× [refs: multiple Mongo find/aggregate calls this session]
- manages internal notifications (echo) and repo issues; 3× [refs: echo to sowmay; GitHub issue request]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- customer segmentation by timezone and engagement; 1× (first: 2025-08-31) [ref: timezone breakdown request]
