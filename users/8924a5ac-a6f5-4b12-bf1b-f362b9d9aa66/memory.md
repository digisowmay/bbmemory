## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- direct technical instructions; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: agent development request chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; follow-up request for full platform code chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]
- requests fully built solutions rather than step-by-step guidance; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: "no develop it for me" chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; selected Option B to receive full code chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- building platform to enable two Vapi agents to interact via phone calls for interview simulation; 2× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: initial platform request chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; requested complete implementation code chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- prefers to configure own account resources; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: insisted on adding agents himself chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; chose code-only option chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]
- delegates technical build to assistant; 2× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: asked assistant to develop entire platform chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; accepted ready-made code chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- asks for development guidance on Vapi integrations; 2× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: initial request for Vapi agent interaction platform chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`; requested full code implementation chatId:`01ba9b7f47b449`]
