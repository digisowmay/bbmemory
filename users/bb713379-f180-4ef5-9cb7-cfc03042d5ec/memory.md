## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives precise, iterative design instructions; 9× (stable since 2025-09-05) [refs: successive logo tweak requests: move text, enhance typography, remove two-tone, delete wave, apply golden ratio chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests mathematical design principles (golden ratio) for aesthetics; 1× (first: 2025-09-05) [ref: golden ratio scaling request chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- refining GEM³ Construction Company LLC logo; 2× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: ongoing logo design conversation chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
