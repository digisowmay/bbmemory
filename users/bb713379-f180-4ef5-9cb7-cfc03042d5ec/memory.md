## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- gives precise, iterative design instructions; 10× (stable since 2025-09-05) [refs: successive logo tweak requests: move text, enhance typography, remove two-tone, delete wave, apply golden ratio, simplify structure chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- requests mathematical design principles (golden ratio) for aesthetics; 4× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: repeated golden ratio scaling and leveraging requests chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]
- asks for cleaner/minimalist adjustments in design; 1× (first: 2025-09-05) [ref: simplify geometric structure request chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- refining GEM³ Construction Company LLC logo; 4× (since 2025-09-05) [refs: ongoing logo design conversation chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- highly detail-oriented, seeks specific visual refinements; 9× (promoted from emerging) [refs: multiple precise change requests: remove wave, two-tone, golden ratio scaling, simplification chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- values proportional harmony and design theory; 4× (last: 2025-09-05) [refs: golden ratio and harmonious scaling requests chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]
- shows preference for minimalist aesthetics; 1× (observed: 2025-09-05) [ref: simplify geometric structure request chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- uses platform frequently for iterative graphic/logo design edits; 10× [refs: sequential logo modifications chatId:`fd7f66d9958b4b`]

### Emerging (new query patterns)
