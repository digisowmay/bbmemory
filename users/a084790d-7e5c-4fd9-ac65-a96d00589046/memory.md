## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- (no durable patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- gives very short, ambiguous technical questions (e.g., single-sentence requests like "How does amplifier work in tv coaxial cable"), requiring follow-up clarification; 5× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: dialog about "tv node" clarification chatId:`d05d2af6339b4a`; diagram request chatId:`d9062b39ee124d`; voltage question chatId:`1bae3afcab124f`; amplifier question chatId:`5d85adf30fdf4b`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- (no durable knowledge patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- interested in technical details of cable TV infrastructure ("tv node", coax power, amplifiers, distribution voltage); 5× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: multiple inquiries about "tv node" chatId:`d05d2af6339b4a`; diagram request chatId:`d9062b39ee124d`; voltage question chatId:`1bae3afcab124f`; amplifier question chatId:`5d85adf30fdf4b`]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- (no durable patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- (no emerging patterns observed yet)

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- (no durable patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- asks exploratory technical questions without providing detailed context; 5× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: "tv node" questions chatId:`d05d2af6339b4a`; diagram request chatId:`d9062b39ee124d`; voltage question chatId:`1bae3afcab124f`; amplifier question chatId:`5d85adf30fdf4b`]
