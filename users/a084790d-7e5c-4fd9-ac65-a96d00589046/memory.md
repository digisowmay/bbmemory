## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- (no durable patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- gives very short, ambiguous technical questions (e.g., single-sentence requests like "Why we have to send 60 volt power in tv coaxial cable"), requiring follow-up clarification; 4× (last: 2025-09-04) [refs: dialog about "tv node" clarification chatId:`d05d2af6339b4a`; diagram request chatId:`d9062b39ee124d`; voltage question chatId:`1bae3afcab124f`]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- (no durable knowledge patterns observed yet)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- interested in technical details of cable TV infrastructure ("tv node", coax power, distribution voltage); 4× (since 2025-09-04) [refs: multiple inquiries about "tv node" chatId:`d05d2af6339b4a`; diagram request chatId:`d9062b39ee124d`; voltage question chatId:`1bae3afcab124f`]
