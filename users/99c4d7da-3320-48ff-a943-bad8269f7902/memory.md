## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)
- 

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- asks direct, imperative questions with minimal context; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: average velocity question; conical pendulum speed]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)
- 

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- practicing introductory physics problem-solving (kinematics, pendulums, error analysis); 3× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: average velocity; unit of b; percentage error in g]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)
- 

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- prefers concise, formula-based answers and step-by-step calculations; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: S1 in terms of S2 & S3; velocity at t=1]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)
- 

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- repeatedly requests solutions to physics homework-style questions; 3× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: series of physics problems in current session]
