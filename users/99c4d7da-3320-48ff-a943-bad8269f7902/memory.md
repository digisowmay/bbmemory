## Communication Patterns
### Durable (established, 3+ reinforcements)

### Emerging (new signals, 1-2 reinforcements)
- Prefers concise, directive queries and expects direct formula-based answers; 2× (last: 2025-08-31) [refs: request for S1 relation; request for average velocity]

## Knowledge & Context
### Durable (core expertise, established over time)

### Emerging (recent learning, current focus)
- Currently working on introductory kinematics problems (constant acceleration, conical pendulum); 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: S1, S2, S3 question; angular speed of conical pendulum]

## Thinking & Working Style
### Durable (core thinking patterns)

### Emerging (recent behavioral shifts)
- Analytical, seeks formula derivations and symbolic relationships; 1× (first: 2025-08-31) [ref: request for S1 in terms of S2 and S3]

## Platform Usage & Queries
### Durable (regular platform activities)

### Emerging (new query patterns)
- Uses AI for both creative image generation and physics homework solutions; 2× (since 2025-08-31) [refs: nano banana image request; successive physics questions]
